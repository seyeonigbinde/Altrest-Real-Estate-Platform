            <h3>Online Payment</h3>
            <p>It allows tenants to set up ALTPay which can also enable Auto Pay to make rent payments automatically on or before the due date. They can also generate automatic receipts for their payments.</p>

            <h3>Maintenance Requests  </h3>
            <p>It has auto-notifications to landlords and tenants on the pending requests and their status. It also has Google Calendar Sync features, the ability for tenants to share the issue with them and include pictures and videos which help narrow down the problem faster, so they donâ€™t have to drive there themselves. Tenants can see the status and communicate without ever having to make a phone call. Landlords, tenants and service professionals can all coordinate for the best time if a visit for repair is needed.</p>

            <h3>Rental Agreements  </h3>
            <p> Tenants can get all the documents from their landlords online and sign them with built-in e-signature.</p>
