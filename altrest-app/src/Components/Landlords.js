            <h2>Landlord</h2>

            <p>  This section of the Tenant Management System allows landlords to organize written agreements with tenants, including points such as when and how you handle tenant complaints, rent payments and repair problems. The following are the details of the services;</p>

            <h3> Online Payments </h3>
            <p> Organizing tenants' payments can be one of the most frustrating parts of property management. It's not frustrating when tenants pay: what's difficult is when they don't pay, pay late, or pay the wrong amount. Our payment platform allows tenants to login to their account, check their outstanding balance, and pay without ever sending the landlord a check. Nothing gets lost in the mail, and the landlord and the tenants are both clear about what's due on the account.</p>

            <h3>  Maintenance Requests</h3>
            <p>This allows the landlord to manage and store one-time and recurring visual maintenance requests and assign those to their local service providers online. It has auto-notifications to landlords and tenants on the pending requests and their status. It also has Google Calendar Sync features, the ability for tenants to share the issue with them and include pictures and videos which help narrow down the problem faster, so they don’t have to drive there themselves. Tenants can see the status and communicate without ever having to make a phone call. Landlords, tenants and service professionals can all coordinate for the best time if a visit for repair is needed.</p>

            <h3> Rental Agreements & Notices </h3>
            <p>It allows landlords to add their own rental lease agreements and notices easily with a document builder and ready-to-use presets. It makes you go paperless and collect signatures on every form and any device with ALTREST’s built-in e-sign feature.</p>

            <h3> Accounting Summary </h3>
            <p>Our various financial and rental reports provide landlords with the most relevant data quickly and easily for them. It allows them to review the report summary or apply filtering, sorting, totalling, and grouping criteria to generate the report they need. Print or export reports to PDF/Excel files. </p>
